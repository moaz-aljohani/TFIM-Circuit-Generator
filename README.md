# TFIM-Circuit-Generator
The TFIM Circuit Generator simulates the 1D Transverse Field Ising Model using Trotterization. It builds quantum circuits based on specified qubits, Trotter steps, and RX rotation angles. The circuit uses custom unitary gates like the square root of the Y gate and its inverse to model qubit interactions in a linear chain.
